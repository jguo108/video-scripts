### Summary

**What if? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions** is a book by **Randall Munroe**, the creator of the stick-figure webcomic xkcd. Published in 2014, the book is a **collection of answers to hypothetical questions** submitted to Munroe through his website, along with some new questions answered for the first time within the book.

Key aspects of the book include:

- **Author's Background and Approach**
    
    - Randall Munroe studied physics and previously worked on robotics at NASA before becoming a full-time cartoonist.
    - His interest in science and maths led him to answer "weird—and sometimes worrying—questions".
    - Munroe believes that "trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places". He acknowledges that his methods for answering questions have improved since childhood, when at age five he tried to calculate whether there were more soft or hard things in the world.
    - The book includes a disclaimer stating that the author is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert, and disclaims responsibility for any adverse effects from the information provided.
- **Content and Style**
    
    - The book tackles a wide array of absurd hypothetical questions using scientific principles, calculations, and humorous stick-figure illustrations.
    - The questions span various scientific disciplines and scenarios, often leading to unexpected or catastrophic conclusions.
- **Examples of Hypothetical Questions and Their Answers:**
    
    - **Global Windstorm:** What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? The answer is that nearly everyone would die, followed by things getting even more interesting.
    - **Relativistic Baseball:** What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? The scenario "doesn’t end well for the batter (or the pitcher)" due to the ball moving at 600 million miles per hour, causing air molecules to appear frozen.
    - **A Mole of Moles:** What would happen if you gathered a mole (Avogadro's number) of moles (the furry critter) in one place? This would result in a "pile of moles on the scale of a planet," roughly half the mass of Earth's Moon, which would form a spherical meat planet that would eventually sterilise itself and freeze solid.
    - **Hair Dryer:** What would happen if an indestructible hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put in an airtight 1 × 1 × 1-meter box? Depending on the power setting, the box would heat up to extreme temperatures, melt most materials, glow brightly, and eventually generate enough power (1.875 gigawatts) to travel back in time according to _Back to the Future_.
    - **Periodic Wall of the Elements:** What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element? This would lead to spontaneous combustion of phosphorus and potassium, release of toxic arsenic trioxide, and the highly radioactive astatine cube would vaporise, causing an explosion and rendering the downwind neighbourhood uninhabitable due to lethal radiation levels.
    - **Rising Steadily:** How exactly would you die if you suddenly began rising steadily at 1 foot per second? You would eventually succumb to hypothermia and then rapidly lose consciousness and die from blood oxygen content plummeting in the "Death Zone" (around the seven-hour mark).
    - **Drain the Oceans:** If a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, how quickly would the oceans drain? It would take hundreds of thousands of years for the ocean to drain, with the water level dropping by less than a centimetre per day initially. The emptying would massively alter the climate and ecosystems, leading to mass extinctions, though humans might survive.
    - **Neutron Bullet:** If a bullet with the density of a neutron star were fired from a handgun at the Earth's surface, could you touch it? Trying to touch it without precautions would result in your arm being stretched and your blood being rapidly drained, but it could be safely touched if surrounded by water, salt, and vodka to adjust buoyancy and density.

In essence, _What If?_ combines scientific inquiry with imaginative, often extreme, hypothetical scenarios, providing detailed and frequently humorous explanations for what might happen.

### Takeaways

Yes, **this book can absolutely be recommended for kids to read, especially when read together with their parents** [previous turn, 6, 7]. While the author, Randall Munroe, explicitly states that he is an "Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert," and humorously warns against trying anything from the book at home because he "likes it when things catch fire or explode", these disclaimers actually provide excellent opportunities for discussion.

The book is uniquely positioned to foster scientific curiosity and critical thinking due to its blend of absurd hypothetical questions, serious scientific answers, and humorous stick-figure illustrations [previous turn, 7, 9].

**Most Important Insights/Inspirations for Kids and Parents:**

- **The Power of Curious Questioning:** The core inspiration is Munroe's belief that "trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places". He illustrates this by recalling his own childhood curiosity about whether there were more soft or hard things in the world. This encourages children to ask any question, no matter how silly it might seem, and see where it leads.
- **Application of Scientific Principles to Real-World (and Absurd) Scenarios:** The book demonstrates how fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics can be applied to understand and predict outcomes in various situations [previous turn]. For example, the "Relativistic Baseball" question delves into extreme physics, while "A Mole of Moles" explores concepts of mass, density, and decomposition [previous turn].
- **Understanding Scale and Magnitude:** Many of the answers deal with incredibly large or small numbers, forces, and timeframes. Questions like "Richter 15" illustrate the immense energy of geological events, comparing it to the Death Star destroying a planet. The "Twitter" chapter uses an ancient parable to demonstrate the unimaginably vast number of possible tweets.
- **The Interconnectedness of Science:** The book often draws on multiple scientific fields to answer a single question, showing how different disciplines are linked (e.g., the physics of re-entry heating applied to cooking steak).
- **Humour as a Tool for Learning:** The pervasive dry wit, self-deprecating humour, and simple stick-figure illustrations make complex topics accessible and engaging [previous turn, 7]. The visual gags reinforce the scientific concepts in a memorable way.
- **The Importance of Data and Research:** Munroe frequently mentions how he sourced his information, from academic papers on ICBM nose cones for the "Steak Drop" to consulting a virology expert for "Common Cold", or even historical records for "New York–Style Time Machine". This subtly teaches the value of evidence-based reasoning.
- **Limits of Knowledge and Predictions:** The book sometimes highlights where current scientific understanding or data runs out, such as the precise drag coefficient for a tumbling steak at hypersonic speeds. This teaches humility in scientific inquiry and the ongoing nature of discovery.

**How a Parent Can Have a Meaningful Conversation:**

1. **Embrace the "What If?" Mindset:**
    
    - **Encourage Questions:** Start by inviting your child to ask "what if" questions about anything that sparks their imagination, no matter how far-fetched. Remind them of Munroe's own childhood question about soft vs. hard things.
    - **Speculate Together:** Before reading Munroe's answer, encourage your child to brainstorm what they think might happen. This activates their prior knowledge and encourages imaginative problem-solving.
2. **Highlight the Scientific Method in Action:**
    
    - **Trace the Reasoning:** After reading an answer, discuss _how_ Munroe arrived at his conclusions. Point out his use of facts, calculations, and logical deductions. For example, when reading "Hair Dryer," discuss how the increase in power leads to increased heat and dramatic effects like melting and explosions.
    - **Identify Scientific Concepts:** Use each chapter as an opportunity to introduce or reinforce scientific concepts. For "No More DNA," you could discuss genes, chromosomes, and the importance of genetic diversity. For "Rising Steadily," talk about air pressure, temperature, and hypothermia at different altitudes.
    - **Discuss Assumptions:** Munroe often states his assumptions (e.g., an indestructible hair dryer, a specific type of storm for the "Raindrop"). Discussing these assumptions helps children understand that scientific models often simplify reality to make problems manageable.
3. **Address the Disclaimers and Safety:**
    
    - **"Do Not Try This At Home":** Directly discuss the disclaimers. Use them to talk about why these experiments are dangerous and should not be attempted. This is a vital lesson in safety and responsible scientific thinking. For instance, after reading about the "Periodic Wall of the Elements," emphasize the dangers of handling highly reactive or radioactive materials.
    - **Real vs. Hypothetical:** Reinforce the difference between hypothetical scenarios and real-world actions. Munroe's humorous notes about liking explosions or ignoring his advice are great starting points for this conversation.
4. **Explore the Unexpected and the Humorous:**
    
    - **Discuss Surprising Outcomes:** Many of the answers have catastrophic or bizarre conclusions. Discuss what surprised you both and why. For example, the idea of a "meat planet" from "A Mole of Moles" is absurd but derived from scientific principles [previous turn, 44].
    - **Analyse the Humour:** Talk about how Munroe uses humour and stick figures to make even serious topics entertaining. What makes certain illustrations or jokes funny? How does the humour help in understanding the science?
5. **Connect to Wider Knowledge and Research:**
    
    - **Fact-Checking (Friendly Style):** If a question sparks further interest, encourage looking up more information together online or in other books. For example, after "Sunless Earth," you could research the real effects of solar flares or the impact of long-term darkness on ecosystems.
    - **Future Possibilities:** Some questions touch upon future technologies or societal changes, such as the "Interplanetary Cessna" or "Facebook of the Dead". These can lead to discussions about technological advancements, ethical considerations, and how societies adapt.
    - **Different Perspectives:** In "Loneliest Human," discuss the differing views of astronauts on solitude. This can open up conversations about human psychology and individual differences.

By engaging with the book's content in these ways, parents can transform it from a mere collection of facts into a dynamic platform for fostering scientific literacy, critical thinking, and a lifelong love of learning in their children.
