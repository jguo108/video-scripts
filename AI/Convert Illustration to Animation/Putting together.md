I have 12 videos (page3.mp4, etc.) which are the animated illustrations of a 12-page children's book, one for each. I also uploaded a json file (text.json), where each item of the array represents the text for each page. 

Now, please create a Please write a story book web app. Here are the requirements:

Background: Full-screen video that autoplays/loops each of the 12 videos I uploaded.  
Foreground: The text from the JSON should appear at the top center.  
Styling: Words of the text should appear and disappear as they are read out. Use a font that matches the vibe of a children's book (like 'Quicksand' or 'Comfortaa' from Google Fonts). 
Navigation: Arrow keys or swipe to change pages.  
Voice: As the video plays, reads the text slowly. Use a female voice that sounds like a kindergarten teacher.
