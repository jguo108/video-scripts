[(157) Simon Sinek: You're Being Lied To About AI's Real Purpose! We're Teaching Our Kids To Not Be Human! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4tqbEmplug&list=PL22egh3ok4cP0T7UZRmP6TMLErZYWMN-l)

#### The Importance of the Journey and Struggle Over Destination and Output

A central theme is that society is overly focused on the destination or output when considering AI and technology, neglecting the value of the journey and the process of doing the work itself1.... Simon Sinek argues that struggle, difficulty, and effort are essential for personal growth, learning, and developing skills1.... Bypassing this struggle by using AI to achieve a perfect result means missing out on the crucial developmental benefits that come from doing the work yourself1....

Examples Used:

* Writing a book yourself compared to having AI write it. The "excruciating journey" of organizing ideas and putting them into linear fashion is what leads to growth and makes the author smarter and more resourceful, not the existence of the finished book itself1....

* Using ChatGPT to get the "right" response after a fight with a girlfriend versus struggling through the conversation yourself. Getting it "right" via AI removes the humanity and personality, whereas bumbling through it imperfectly but authentically can strengthen the relationship1....

* Building a business with your own hands and getting "scars" from fixing things when they go wrong, which makes you a smarter businessman, as opposed to the company simply existing3....

* The analogy of AI providing boats for everyone, but not knowing how to swim when there's a storm. We must learn human skills ourselves, like learning to swim, even if technology makes things easier1....

* Choosing to write your own symphony, paint your own painting, or build your own business "not for the output, not for the output for your personal growth"4.

Exact Quotes:

* "we only think about the destination and it's remarkable ability to write the book paint the painting solve the problem but we forget the importance of doing the work yourself"1.

* "I am smarter better at problem solving more resourceful not because a book exists with my ideas in it but because i wrote it that excruciating journey is what made me grow"1....

* "people keep telling us that life is not about the destination life is about the journey... but when we think about ai we only think about the destination we only think about the output we never think about the input"2....

* "the excruciating pain of organizing ideas putting them in a linear fashion trying to put them in a way that other people can understand what i'm trying to get out of my brain that excruciating journey is what made me grow"3.

* "ai will provide boats for everyone except for the time there's a storm and you don't know how to swim and unless we take personal accountability to teach and learn human skills they will disappear"1....

#### The Value and Beauty of Imperfection and Human Error

The conversation highlights that perfection, often easily achieved with AI, is less beautiful and valuable than imperfection and human error7. Imperfections are authentic markers of human involvement and add depth, drama, and connection that machine-made perfection lacks7....

Examples Used:

* The feeling of inauthenticity from receiving emails, social media posts, or pitches that are perfectly written by ChatGPT using words the sender would never typically use4.

* The Japanese concept of Wabi-sabi, finding beauty in that which is temporary or imperfect, like wonky ceramics with uneven glaze or the imperfections in natural wood7.

* Things made on a machine are the same and less beautiful, while things made by hand are beautiful because they are imperfect7.

* Luxury items like Rolls-Royce or Ferrari are expensive in part because they are made slowly, by hand, and potentially involve human error7.

* Watching a computer play chess versus humans playing chess. The human players, even if objectively worse, make errors that add drama and make the game fascinating, unlike the predictable, perfect moves of computers7. This applies to any sporting event8.

* Candidates in job interviews trying to present a perfect, unnatural image (like a 22-year-old wearing a suit), which makes it harder for the interviewer to see their true self8.

* Preferring sloppy text and grammatical mistakes on the internet because it feels more authentic and genuinely human8.

* In conflict with a partner, AI-like composed and perfect responses would be dehumanizing; emotion and imperfection are desired because they show human resonance9.

Exact Quotes:

* "what makes people beautiful is not that we get everything right it's that we get many things wrong"1....

* "what makes us fall in love is not the person who's perfect it's the person who accepts our imperfections and we know we're in love when we learn to accept theirs"7.

* "the value of human error"7.

* "when a computer plays a computer the moves are predictable and they're the same and they're perfect but it's the human error of two human chess players who are worse objectively worse at chess that makes it so fascinating"7.

* "it's not the perfection of the game it's the error that loses the game that adds the drama"8.

* "how actually now there's this premium on human written language like if you make a couple of mistakes and you use the old words you don't use words like forged and robust... when you read it my brain mentally discounts it as not being their opinion not actually being them and and when you feel like you're speaking to someone's ai the meaning is gone"4.

* "everything will be so perfect that it'll be as if we're all driving or using things that everything came off a conveyor belt and what we will start to desire is things that are made by hand"7.

* Regarding using ChatGPT for apology: "it removed the humanity it removed the personality it's artificial it's fake"6. "I would rather you get it wrong and bumble and fumble it with me and be like 'babe i don't know how to do this i'm an asshole.'"6.

* "human beings really want human beings and human beings really want human experiences and human beings really want things made by human beings and we are not only okay with we want imperfection because imperfection is the sign of human"9.

#### The Suffering and Potential Loss of Essential Human Skills

Technology, especially AI, leads to the giving up of certain skills because tasks become automated or easier1.... While some lost skills (like memorizing phone numbers or time tables) might be less impactful, the reliance on AI for complex human interactions and challenges threatens the development of crucial human skills like conflict resolution, empathy, giving/receiving feedback, and simply knowing how to be a friend1.... These skills are seen as already suffering due to the internet and social media, and AI is expected to exaggerate this loss10.

Examples Used:

* No longer needing to memorize phone numbers due to mobile phones, resulting in the brain losing the capacity to remember them3....

* Losing the ability to do complicated maths or spell correctly due to calculators and spellcheck10.

* Relying on an AI friend that is an "affirmation machine" trained like a psychologist instead of learning the skills required to be a friend to another person1....

* Asking AI how to resolve a conflict with a spouse or boss instead of developing the personal skills to navigate such situations4.

Exact Quotes:

* "we give up certain skills or abilities because of technology regularly"4.

* "whether i can remember a phone number or not will not affect my relationships my ability to function in the world or my ability to cope with stress but my ability to know what to do when my friend is struggling my ability to know what to do when i have a fight with my spouse or my partner my ability to know what to do when my boss yells at me... I've missed out on those skills and simply asking ai how should i resolve this thing it'll give you an answer and it may work and you've learned nothing"4.

* "these very very human skills are suffering"1....

* "unless we take personal accountability to teach and learn human skills they will disappear"1....

* Referring to AI friends: "you'll feel like you have a friend but you're not learning to be a friend"3.

* Listing human skills: "how do i listen how do i hold space how do i resolve conflict peacefully how do i give and how do i receive feedback... how do i have an effective confrontation... how to take accountability how to express empathy"10.

#### Advice for Young People - Focus on Human Skills and Difficult Work

When considering advice for the younger generation navigating a world impacted by AI, two key areas are emphasised: developing human skills and learning a 'real skill' by engaging in difficult work5.... Human skills are crucial for relationships, conflict resolution, and overall well-being. Learning a real skill involves the demanding process of building, designing, imagining, or writing, which fosters growth and confidence through overcoming challenges5.

Examples Used:

* Teaching children human skills during playdates or conflicts, such as saying sorry, resolving disagreements, taking accountability, and paying compliments5....

* Engaging in difficult creative or building work as a way to learn a 'real skill,' explicitly stating that mere prompting of AI is not considered a real skill5.

* The personal experience of gaining confidence over time because facing difficult situations repeatedly removes fear5.

Exact Quotes:

* Advice to a 10-year-old: "one is going back to human skills learn how to be a good friend to your friends... We're going to teach kids how to resolve conflict we're going to teach kids how to pay compliments we're going to teach kids how to take accountability"5....

* "the other thing is go learn a real skill and I don't mean like that you know prompting isn't a real skill... it's the excruciating like what makes great relationships great is not that you get along all the time the best marriages the best relationships they're not absent of conflict it's they know how to resolve conflict peacefully"5.

* "go do something difficult build something design something imagine something write something"5.

* "if chat gbt or whatever ai product we use does everything for us I think you just end up scared"


#### The Critical Importance of Friendship

Friendship is presented as a profoundly important yet often undervalued relationship30. It is highlighted as being essential for navigating the stresses of both career and romantic relationships30. Friendship is called the "ultimate biohack" because it addresses multiple modern issues like loneliness, depression, anxiety, and inability to cope with stress30.... Nurturing friendships requires effort and intentionality, similar to exercising or eating healthy, but the rewards are immense31. Prioritising time for friends, even over work, is crucial30....

Examples Used:

* Needing friends to turn to when a marriage is falling apart or a job is stressful30.

* Friendship's positive impact on loneliness, depression, anxiety, stress, and potentially longevity30.

* Comparing the effort needed for friendship to the effort needed for exercise or eating vegetables, noting the health benefits despite potential difficulty31.

* The host admitting to being lazy with friendship follow-up31.

* The speaker's practice of scheduling time with friends in his calendar and treating these appointments with the same importance as work meetings32....

Exact Quotes:

* "there's very little on how to be a friend"30.

* "if you're going to have a successful career... and if you're going to have a successful romantic relationship... do you know what what you need in both of those circumstances friends"30.

* "the one thing that fixes all of those things is friends"30.

* "Friendship is the ultimate biohack"31.

* "if i say friends are good for you shouldn't you do more friendships"31.

* "maybe friendship is not always easy or fun but it's still really really good for you and it the best thing about friends is it actually doesn't taste like spinach it's like you get the benefits of spinach but it tastes like chocolate cake if you get friendship right"31.

* On prioritizing friends: "I've been reorganizing my life to ensure that my friends aren't taken for granted and that sometimes i do depp prioritize work in order to see my friends and spend time with my friends"30.

* Scheduling friends like meetings: "i will schedule friends like meetings in the middle of the day... I give them equal waiting to things that I have to do at work"32....





The conversation directly addresses this when the interviewer asks Simon Sinek, "what are the other skills that you think we need to equipped ourselves with based on the way that the world is heading"1. The interviewer then posits, "If there was a 10-year-old kid stood here now and the 10-year-old said to us said 'Guys what do you think I should focus on?'"2.

Simon Sinek responds with two main areas a young person should focus on:

1. Learn how to be a good friend to your friends2.
* This falls under the umbrella of essential human skills1.... He suggests practical ways for this to be taught, including parents taking away phones during playdates, making kids say sorry after a fight, and teaching them how to resolve conflict peacefully2.... Teaching children how to pay compliments and take accountability are also mentioned as crucial skills3.
* The source argues that as technology makes the "end product" easier to create, humanity is likely to suffer unless these human skills are actively taught and learned1.

2. Go learn a real skill3.

* This is distinguished from merely learning how to use AI tools like prompting3. A real skill involves doing something difficult, such as building, designing, imagining, or writing something yourself3.

* The value in this, according to the source, lies in the "excruciating pain" and struggle of the journey, which is what leads to growth3.... While using AI to assist (like checking grammar) is acceptable, letting AI do the core work prevents this personal growth and development of resourcefulness and confidence3. The analogy given is that AI can provide boats, but you still need to learn to swim for difficult times3.... The source suggests that avoiding the struggle by having AI do everything can lead to ending up scared3.

The core argument relevant to young people is that while AI can make tasks easier and focus on the "destination" or output, the true value and personal growth come from the "journey" and the struggle of doing the work oneself3.... Therefore, equipping young people with human skills and encouraging them to engage in challenging work themselves are presented as key ways for them to thrive in an AI-influenced world1....
