### Prompt to NotebookLM to get an infographic

Base on the content of Mars, create an infographic based on the following guidelines:
### 1. Colors
The color palette is **bold, high-contrast, and vibrant**, designed specifically to appeal to a younger audience while maintaining scientific clarity.
- **Background:** A deep, solid black background simulates space, providing maximum contrast for the text and graphics.
- **Primary Hues:** Saturated cyan (Earth/Atmosphere), bright yellow (Sun/Information boxes), and magenta/pink (Orbits/Accents) create a "CMYK" print aesthetic.
- **Functional Coding:** Colors are used functionally—blue consistently represents Earth/Water/Air, while yellow highlights key facts or solar elements.
- **Texture:** The colors have a subtle, distressed "spatter" or "sponge" texture, giving them a tactile, organic feel rather than a flat digital look.
### 2. Typography
The typography is playful and varied, mimicking a hand-made poster or zine.
- **Headlines:** The main titles ("Alien's Guide...", "Earth Is") use a tall, condensed **sans-serif font with a rough, hand-stamped texture**. This adds to the "guidebook" theme.
- **Body Text:** Informational text is largely sans-serif, legible but slightly informal.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Font sizes vary drastically to guide the eye—key numbers (3rd, 5th, 365 1/4) are massive to ensure they are the first things read.
- **Styling:** Text is often white against the black background for readability, or black inside colored boxes. Curved text follows the shape of planets or orbits to integrate words dynamically with images.
### 3. Layout
The layout is **modular and scattered**, resembling a "fact sheet" or a dashboard rather than a linear narrative.
- **Z-Pattern Flow:** Despite the scattered look, the eye is generally guided from the top left (Title) across the planetary lineup, then down through the specific Earth facts (Day/Night, Moon, Air).
- **Grouping:** Information is grouped into distinct "islands" or clusters (e.g., the "Leap Year" math section, the "Air on Earth" pie chart).
- **Connectors:** Dotted lines, arrows, and orbits act as visual connectors, tying the disparate facts together and showing relationships (like the distance from the sun or the moon's orbit).
### 4. Illustration Style
The illustration style is **flat, textured, and semi-abstract**.
- **Simplification:** Planets and objects are reduced to simple geometric shapes (circles, arcs). Continents on Earth are abstract green blobs rather than accurate maps.
- **Texture Over Detail:** Instead of realistic gradients or 3D shading, the illustrator uses noisy, grainy textures (resembling chalk or screen printing) to give depth and visual interest.
- **Character:** A small alien character in a spaceship appears in the bottom right, reinforcing the "Alien's Guide" narrative frame and adding a sense of whimsy.
- **Diagrammatic Elements:** Scientific concepts are visualized through simple diagrams—pie charts for air composition, a split circle for day/night, and size comparison visuals (Earth vs. Moon).
