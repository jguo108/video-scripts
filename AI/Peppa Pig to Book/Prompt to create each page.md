The following is a script break down of all the pages of a Peppa Pig style children's book. 

SCENE 1: The Playroom  
Peppa and George are playing on the floor. It is a rainy day.

NARRATOR  
It is a rainy day. Peppa and George are playing in their bedroom.  
George is playing with his dinosaurs.

GEORGE  
Dine-saw! Grrr!

NARRATOR  
George has a lot of dinosaurs.

Page 2  
PEPPA  
George, you have too many dinosaurs all over the floor. We must count them properly.  
I will teach you. I am very good at counting.

NARRATOR  
Peppa is being a little bit bossy.

Page 3  
PEPPA  
Look at your hands, George. You have ten fingers. We use the Decimal System.  
Imagine you count ten tiny dinosaurs. One, two, three... all the way to ten.

GEORGE  
(Looking at his fingers)  
Ooh.

Page 4  
PEPPA  
When you get to the tenth dinosaur, you must imagine putting them all into a giant pile of mud.

NARRATOR  
Peppa loves muddy puddles. And piles of mud.

PEPPA  
Then you start counting again. But you must remember that the big mud pile means ten.

GEORGE  
Mud! Hee hee!

SCENE 2: Daddy Pig enters  
Daddy Pig walks in holding a very big book about computers.

Page 5  
DADDY PIG  
Ho ho! Are you counting? I am doing some very important work on my computer.  
Computers count in a different way. It is called Binary.

NARRATOR  
Daddy Pig is an expert at computers. Or he thinks he is.

Page 6  
DADDY PIG  
Decimal uses ten numbers. But Binary is much simpler. It only uses two options.  
It is like a dinosaur that can only make two sounds.

GEORGE  
Dine-saw?

Page 7  
DADDY PIG  
Yes, George. Imagine a dinosaur that says a loud, happy "ROAR!" or a quiet "hush."  
Those are the only two choices. 1 and 0. Loud and quiet.

GEORGE  
(Loudly)  
ROAR!  
(Whispering)  
Hush...

NARRATOR  
George is very good at being a Binary Dinosaur.

SCENE 3: Mummy Pig helps  
Mummy Pig comes in with a tray of juice.

Page 8  
MUMMY PIG  
That sounds very clever, Daddy Pig. But what is the tiny sound called?

NARRATOR  
Mummy Pig is very sensible.

Page 9  
DADDY PIG  
Ah. Well. It is called... um...

MUMMY PIG  
It is called a "Bit," Daddy Pig. A bit is the basic building block of information.  
It is the tiniest message you can send.

Page 10  
MUMMY PIG  
Look at George’s bright red dinosaur.  
It is like being on the playground. If you hold the red toy up, it means "Yes!"

(George holds the red dinosaur up high)

Page 11  
MUMMY PIG  
And if you hide the red toy, it means "No!"

(George hides the dinosaur behind his back)

NARRATOR  
A bit is a simple, two-way choice. Up or down. Yes or No.

SCENE 4: The Kitchen  
The family moves to the kitchen for a snack.

Page 12  
PEPPA  
I like bits. They are very easy.  
Can I send a bit to ask for a cookie?

DADDY PIG  
Ho ho! That is an excellent idea, Peppa.

Page 13  
DADDY PIG  
My tummy is trying to send a bit.  
I wonder if it is saying "hush" for a salad... or "ROAR" for chocolate cake?

NARRATOR  
Daddy Pig’s tummy makes a very loud rumble.

Page 14  
GEORGE  
ROAR! Dine-saw!

PEPPA  
Daddy’s tummy is definitely saying "Roar!" That means "Yes" to cake!

Page 15  
DADDY PIG  
(Laughing)  
Ho ho ho! You are right. I am a very clever computer expert, but I am even better at eating cake.

NARRATOR  
Daddy Pig loves cake. Everyone loves cake.

(Daddy Pig leans back to laugh and accidentally tips his chair)

DADDY PIG  
Whoops!

(They all fall onto the soft rug)

ALL  
Hahahahahaha!

NARRATOR  
Everyone falls over laughing.
