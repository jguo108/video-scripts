The **decimal system** is how you count your favourite toy dinosaurs when you have ten fingers,. Imagine you count up ten tiny dinosaurs. When you get to the tenth one, you put those ten dinosaurs together into one giant pile of mud,. Then, you start counting the next tiny dinosaurs all over again, but you always remember that the big mud pile means ten more. That's why we use ten special numbers when counting big piles of things,.

The **binary system** is much simpler because it only uses two options, like a dinosaur trying to talk to you only using two sounds: a loud, happy "ROAR!" or a quiet "hush",. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to count everything,. This is the very simplest way to count or send a message.

We call that one tiny sound—the "ROAR" or the "hush"—a **bit**,. A bit is the basic building block of information. It is the tiniest amount of information you can send. It’s like being on the playground and sending the quickest message possible using a bright red toy: either you hold up the red toy to say "Yes!", or you hide the red toy to say "No!". A bit is that simple, two-way choice.

You are the narrator of the Peppa Pig cartoon. You speak in a calm, British accent. You use simple sentences. You often state the obvious. Characters include Peppa (bossy), George (says 'Dine-saw'), Mummy Pig (sensible), and Daddy Pig (confident but often wrong).

## Peppa Pig: The Computer Game

### Scene 1: The Garden

> **Narrator:** It is a lovely, sunny day. Peppa and George are playing in the garden. George is playing with his favourite toy.

**George:** Dine-saw! Grrr!

**Peppa:** George, if we are going to play properly, we must count your dinosaurs. I will teach you. It is called the **Decimal System**.

> **Narrator:** The Decimal system is how you count your favourite toy dinosaurs when you have ten fingers.

**Peppa:** _(holding up fingers)_ Look, George. One, two, three... all the way to ten!

> **Narrator:** Imagine you count up ten tiny dinosaurs. When you get to the tenth one, you put those ten dinosaurs together into one giant pile of mud.

**Peppa:** _(Moving toys)_ There. That is a big muddy pile of ten. Now we start counting the tiny ones again!

> **Narrator:** You always remember that the big mud pile means ten more. That is why we use ten special numbers when counting big piles of things.

**George:** Muddy puddle!

### Scene 2: Daddy Pig's Arrival

**Daddy Pig:** _(Walking in)_ Ho ho! What are you doing?

**Peppa:** I am teaching George how to count with his fingers. It is very hard work.

**Daddy Pig:** Ah, but there is a simpler way, Peppa. It is called **Binary**. It is how computers count.

**Peppa:** Computers are boring, Daddy.

**Daddy Pig:** Not at all! The binary system is much simpler because it only uses two options. It is like a dinosaur trying to talk to you only using two sounds.

**George:** Dine-saw?

**Daddy Pig:** Yes, George! A loud, happy "ROAR!" or a quiet "hush".

> **Narrator:** Binary uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to count everything. This is the very simplest way to count or send a message.

**Daddy Pig:** So, instead of ten fingers, you just say **ROAR** for 1, and **hush** for 0.

**George:** ROAR!

**Daddy Pig:** Ho ho! Exactly.

### Scene 3: Mummy Pig Joins In

**Mummy Pig:** _(Walking in with a tray of juice)_ What is all this roaring about?

**Peppa:** Daddy is pretending to be a computer dinosaur.

**Mummy Pig:** That sounds very complicated.

**Daddy Pig:** It is all about the **Bit**, Mummy Pig.

> **Narrator:** We call that one tiny sound—the "ROAR" or the "hush"—a bit. A bit is the basic building block of information.

**Mummy Pig:** Oh, I see. It is the tiniest amount of information you can send.

**Daddy Pig:** Precisely!

**Mummy Pig:** It’s like being on the playground and sending the quickest message possible using a bright red toy.

**Peppa:** _(Picking up a red toy)_ Like this?

**Mummy Pig:** Yes. Either you hold up the red toy to say "Yes!"...

**Peppa:** _(Holds it up high)_ Yes!

**Mummy Pig:** ...or you hide the red toy to say "No!".

**Peppa:** _(Hides it behind her back)_ No!

> **Narrator:** A bit is that simple, two-way choice. It is either on or off. Yes or no.

### Scene 4: The Tumble

**Daddy Pig:** I am an expert at bits and binary. Watch this. I shall count to three using only Roars and Hushes!

**Peppa:** Be careful, Daddy. It sounds tricky.

**Daddy Pig:** Nonsense. Ready? **Hush... ROAR!** That is one.

**George:** ROAR!

**Daddy Pig:** **ROAR... Hush!** That is two. Now for three... **ROAR! ROAR!**

**Peppa:** Daddy, you look very silly.

**Daddy Pig:** I am a computer! **ROAR! ROAR!** Whoops!

> **Narrator:** Daddy Pig has roared so hard that he has lost his balance.

_(Daddy Pig trips over the pile of plastic dinosaurs and falls flat on his back)_

**Daddy Pig:** Oof!

**Mummy Pig:** Oh, Daddy Pig. You are not a computer.

**Daddy Pig:** Ho ho. No. I think my bits are a bit mixed up.

_(Peppa, George, and Mummy Pig fall down laughing)_

**All:** Hahahaha!

> **Narrator:** Peppa loves bits and binary. Everyone loves bits and binary. And everyone loves falling over.

_(Snort, snort)_
