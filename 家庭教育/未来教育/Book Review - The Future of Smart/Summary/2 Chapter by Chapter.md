Based on the provided excerpts from "The Future of Smart" by Ulcca Joshi Hansen, here is a chapter-by-chapter summary, drawing on the available information:

The book overall challenges the conventional definition of "smart," which is described as a flattened and largely dehumanised idea of human capability based on centuries of bias. It is presented as one of the organising principles of society and education, posing a threat to the development of children and communities. The author argues that the education system needs to change to help all young people thrive. The book explores what "smart" should mean, suggesting it should value the complexity and richness of humanity and the many ways people contribute to the world. It proposes transforming education towards a **human-centered/liberatory** approach, also referred to as **holistic-indigenous learning (HIL)**. This transformation is presented as necessary to address issues like income stratification and racial injustice, and to align education with modern understandings of learning, brain development, neurodiversity, and the future world.

**Part 1: Past: (A Brief Overview of) How We Got Here**

- **Chapter 1: Education at a Crossroads**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter sets the historical stage, exploring the centuries-long tension between two worldviews, framed as mirroring the left and right hemispheres of the brain. It questions the effectiveness of past education reforms and the underlying assumptions about learning. It critiques the **dominance of a "left-hemisphere" approach** in reform efforts, which focuses on measurable outcomes and standardisation without examining the fundamental purpose of education.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **"A Nation at Risk" (1983) and "Americaâ€™s Choice: High Skills or Low Wages" (1990) reports:** These influential reports highlighted concerns about the US education system. The "America's Choice" report recommended an **"outcomes- or standards-based" approach**, identifying a lack of clarity on teaching goals and insufficient incentives as key problems. This evidence supports the claim that past reforms focused on quantifiable results and standardisation.
        - **The "America's Choice" study:** A year-long project involving executives and experts, this study interviewed thousands of people across hundreds of US companies and examined systems in six other countries. It aimed to understand how systems cultivate a skilled workforce. This detail illustrates the scale and focus of reform efforts rooted in economic and labour market concerns.
        - **Left vs. Right Hemisphere Functioning:** The chapter uses this as a metaphor to describe contrasting perspectives. The **left hemisphere** is characterised by taking things out of context, identifying features, naming, abstracting, seeking to know what to do and mean, and seeing things as either/or. The **right hemisphere** sees things in context, experiences connections, makes things vivid and concrete, is attuned to how things feel and simply are, and is more both/and. The left is described as processing data for analysis and codification, while the right integrates experience. This metaphor provides the conceptual framework for the worldview divide discussed throughout the book.
        - **Critique of Left-Hemisphere Dominance in Reform:** Experts leading past reforms are described as having thrived in individualistic, standardised systems. They focused on identifying "glitches, inefficiencies, and opportunities for better performance," leading to recommendations for **more measurement, abstraction, and comparison**. They are seen as not questioning the system itself or the essence of learning. This directly illustrates the manifestation of the "left-hemisphere" approach in educational reform efforts and supports the claim that these efforts were limited.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The evidence highlights the historical context of education reform in the US, showing a consistent focus on standardisation and measurable outcomes as a response to perceived problems. The left/right hemisphere metaphor provides a framework to understand the nature and limitations of this dominant approach. By detailing how this perspective shaped past reforms, the chapter lays the groundwork for the book's argument that a different worldview is needed for meaningful change.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter establishes the historical narrative of how the current education system, heavily influenced by a specific worldview and past reform efforts, came to be. By critiquing this historical path and the assumptions embedded within it, it provides the essential "how we got here" context, making the case for why a fundamental transformation is necessary, as advocated by the book's overall thesis.
- **Chapter 2: The Origins of the Divide in Our Modern Worldviews**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter delves into the historical roots of the two contrasting worldviews central to the book: the **Cartesian-Newtonian** and the **holistic-indigenous**. It explains how the Cartesian-Newtonian worldview emerged around the 1500s in Europe and subsequently gained dominance, impacting science and society.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Emergence of Cartesian-Newtonian Worldview:** This perspective is presented as a shorthand for a worldview that developed in the 1500s in Europe. It is characterised by an emphasis on the **individual over the collective, objectivity over felt experience, and dominance over symbiosis**. This forms the historical origin point for the dominant worldview that the book argues underpins the current education system.
        - **Contrast with Holistic-Indigenous Worldview:** The term "indigenous" is used broadly to refer to ways of being and organising human life **before the arrival of outside forces**, based on intuitive, local values. This worldview is described as pre-existing and foundational, serving as a counterpoint to the Cartesian-Newtonian view. The description highlights the alternative perspective that existed and was largely suppressed.
        - **Societal Impact of the Shift:** The dominance of the Cartesian-Newtonian worldview, with its emphasis on individualism and objectivity, is linked to major historical developments like **colonisation, the establishment of the United States, and the Industrial Revolution**. The author notes that "much was lost in the process, including indigenous and collective ways of being and knowing". This demonstrates the profound and far-reaching consequences of this worldview shift across various societal domains.
        - **Connection to Racism:** The chapter mentions **Resmaa Menakem's** suggestion that racism and white-body supremacy have roots in the same historical period and traumatise everyone. This explicitly links the historical worldview shift to ongoing social injustices.
        - **Visual Representation (Image 2):** A diagram visually contrasts the Cartesian-Newtonian and Holistic-Indigenous worldviews through associated concepts and fields, such as classical physics/economics vs. quantum physics/behavioural economics, domination of nature vs. ecology/conservation, hyper-individualism vs. collectivism, and hierarchical vs. flat/networked organisations. This provides a concrete illustration of the abstract differences between the two worldviews.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The evidence establishes the deep historical and philosophical divide that the book uses to analyse contemporary educational issues. By explaining the characteristics and origins of the dominant Cartesian-Newtonian worldview and contrasting it with the holistic-indigenous alternative, the chapter provides the fundamental theoretical underpinning for the book's critique and proposed solution. The link to historical injustices like colonisation and racism highlights the ethical dimensions of this worldview divide.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter provides the essential **philosophical foundation** for the entire book. It explains the two opposing worldviews that inform the discussion of education in subsequent chapters. By showing how the dominant worldview shaped society and lost "indigenous and collective ways of being and knowing", it explains _why_ the current system operates as it does and builds the case for the need to embrace the alternative holistic-indigenous perspective to create a more just and effective education system.
- **Chapter 3: The Worldview Divide in Education**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter specifically examines how the worldview divide discussed in Chapter 2 manifested within the field of education. It describes the rise of the **Industrial Model of Education** as a consequence of the dominant worldview and acknowledges dissenting voices and holistic approaches.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Rise of the Industrial Model:** Following the Scientific Revolution, society and its conception of people became more mechanistic and reductionistic. Education mirrored this shift, leading to the development of **mass, factory schooling**, which began in the eighteenth century and is seen as relevant to the era of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top in the US.
        - **Characteristics of the Industrial Model:** This model focused on identifying, organising, and delivering educational content efficiently. It involved **regular testing** to ensure mastery and evaluated teachers based on student performance. This evidence shows the practical implementation of the dominant worldview's principles (efficiency, measurement, standardisation) in schooling.
        - **Contrast with Earlier Education:** Before this shift, education in European indigenous societies was integrated into family and community life, focused on practical skills needed for living, and was embodied, contextualised, and meaningful. Formal education was limited to wealthy males. This contrast highlights how the Industrial Model represented a significant departure from previous, more holistic approaches to learning.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The chapter's evidence directly links the historical shift towards a mechanistic worldview (Chapter 2) to the concrete changes in educational practices, resulting in the Industrial Model. This demonstrates how abstract philosophical ideas translated into the structure and methods of schooling, shaping the system that exists today. The contrast with earlier forms of education reinforces the idea that the Industrial Model is a constructed system, not an inherent way of learning.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter provides the direct link between the broad worldview discussion and the specific context of education. By explaining how the dominant worldview gave rise to the Industrial Model, it deepens the historical critique of the current system and reinforces the book's argument that its limitations and inequities are rooted in its foundational design principles.
- **Chapter 4: Holistic-Indigenous and Ecological Values in Education**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter explores the principles and values of a **holistic-indigenous and ecological approach to education**. It contrasts this with the dominant model, discussing how it reframes the purpose of education, the nature of knowledge, and advocates for a shift from merely seeking equity to pursuing **liberation**. It highlights the importance of honouring the uniqueness of each person.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Focus on Uniqueness and Self-Worth:** The chapter is said to explore what it means when education honours and centers the uniqueness of each person. It references **Regena Thomasheur's idea of "sharing a brag"** as a practice that counters the cultural emphasis on competition and shame, instead promoting the idea that unique aspects are gifts to be shared and celebrated. This provides a specific example of a practice aligned with valuing individual identity.
        - **Priorities of Systems Grounded in Holistic-Indigenous Values:** A prompt asks the reader to consider what systems grounded in these values would prioritise, implicitly suggesting a focus different from the Cartesian-Newtonian.
        - **Shift from Equity to Liberatory:** The chapter title explicitly includes this shift. The discussion of the Human-Centered/Liberatory orientation (linked to this worldview) in Appendix A and Chapter 6 notes that its purpose includes **"social justice / liberation"**, going beyond just achieving equity.
        - **Embedding of Values and Character:** The Human-Centered/Liberatory approach described in the framework involves the **"infusion approach to character development,"** where values and character are deeply embedded within the curriculum. This contrasts with more functional or curriculum-based approaches in other orientations. This illustrates how core values are integrated into the learning experience in this approach.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The examples and concepts presented define the core tenets of the holistic-indigenous educational approach, emphasising the value of the individual, a broader purpose beyond traditional academics (including liberation and social justice), and the integrated nature of learning and character development. This provides a positive vision for what education _could_ be, directly contrasting with the critique of the dominant system.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter presents the core alternative framework that the book proposes for transforming education. By detailing the values and principles of the holistic-indigenous approach, it offers a clear picture of the desired future state of education, directly supporting the overall argument for a shift away from the limitations of the conventional, Cartesian-Newtonian-based system.

**Part 2: Present: Shifting Our Gaze**

- **Chapter 5: From Theory to Practice: The Instructional-Model Framework**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter introduces a framework for understanding different educational practices in the present, moving from theory to practical application. It explores the challenges faced by schools attempting to implement holistic approaches and uses **case studies** to illustrate divergent experiences and instructional models.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Instructional-Model (IM) Framework:** Developed through the Instructional Orientations project, this framework helps understand how schools organise to meet diverse student needs. It identifies **six "instructional-model elements" (IME)** used to classify schools: primary purpose, approach to developmental needs, discipline/character, beliefs about learning, pedagogical approach, and assessment methods. This framework provides the analytical toolset used in this part of the book.
        - **Challenges for Holistic-Indigenous Approaches:** The author notes that HIL programs struggle to gain traction within the dominant system. Designing these programs without a template can lead to **"exhaustion and chaos"**. This highlights the practical difficulties in translating the holistic-indigenous theory into widespread practice in the current context.
        - **Case Studies (Examples provided in sources):** Although not explicitly confined to Chapter 5, the sources present case studies that align with this chapter's theme of divergent experiences and instructional models.
            - **King's Green School (KGS):** A non-traditional public school serving a diverse, challenging student population. It was founded with a commitment to progressive education, social justice, and equity. KGS exemplified HIL themes of **wholeness, interconnectedness, and embodiment/contextualisation**, viewing students as whole human beings and focusing on building community and shared responsibility. They used interdisciplinary teaching and varied learning methods. The experience at KGS informed the understanding that designing HIL programs without a template is challenging.
            - **BPS:** This school emphasizes community living, personal relationships, and shared tasks (cooking, gardening, maintenance). Decisions are made collectively. The schedule is intentionally different from the mainstream. Discipline relies on **voluntary adherence within the community**, emphasizing that freedom is responsibility in cooperation.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The IM framework provides a structured method for analysing diverse educational practices. The discussion of challenges highlights the difficulties of implementing alternative models within a system designed for conventional approaches. The case studies provide concrete, detailed examples of schools attempting holistic approaches, showcasing their distinct characteristics and operational principles, and illustrating the practical realities of diverging from the conventional model.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter moves the book's focus from historical critique to the current landscape of educational practice. By introducing the IM framework and presenting examples of schools operating outside the dominant paradigm, it demonstrates that alternative approaches are possible and are being attempted. It also highlights the systemic barriers faced by these innovative programs, setting the stage for the discussion of how the system needs to change in Part 3.
- **Chapter 6: How the Worldview Divide Lives On through Educational Orientations**
    
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** Building on Chapter 5, this chapter directly links the historical worldview divide (from Part 1) to present-day educational practices by defining and exploring three **"educational orientations"**: Conventional, Whole Child/Innovative Reform, and Human-Centered/Liberatory (HIL). It shows how these orientations differ in their approach to core educational elements and how the dominant worldview is perpetuated through the Conventional orientation.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Identification of Three Educational Orientations:** Based on observations and research using the IM framework, the author identified three distinct orientations: Conventional, Whole Child/Innovative Reform, and Human-Centered/Liberatory. This classification provides a model for understanding the spectrum of educational approaches currently in practice.
        - **Defining Characteristics of Orientations:** A table visually summarises the key defining characteristics of each orientation across the six IM elements (Purpose, Human development, Discipline/character, Theory of learning, Approach to teaching, Assessment of learning, Cognitive strengths served).
            - **Conventional:** Primarily academic focus towards standards. Limited attention to human development in curriculum. Functionalist approach to social-emotional development for academic performance or college prep; character as "habits of scholars". Focus on traits aligned with academic success; consequentialist discipline. Sequential, linear, paced learning theory. Teacher-directed/guided teaching. Standardised assessments. Serves strong verbal/sequential learners well.
            - **Human-Centered/Liberatory (HIL):** Purpose is individual development, social justice/liberation. Human development is central; progress is individualised. Systems perspective on socio-emotional development, focusing on self-regulation; relationships are foundational. Character/values infused and embedded; restorative justice. Developmentally influenced, practical, experiential learning theory. Project-based, situational, internship teaching. Portfolios, exhibitions, authentic assessment, self-assessment focused. Serves a wide range of cognitive strengths, including high visual/perceptual, varying processing, flexible memory/attention, holistic/sequential processing, and socio-emotional challenges.
        - **Neurodiversity and Cognitive Profiles:** The chapter integrates knowledge from cognitive psychology about the diversity of cognitive skills among learners. It argues that the Conventional system often **"labels and stigmatizes"** children whose brains don't fit the norm, linking this to diagnoses like dyslexia or "special needs". The HIL orientation is presented as being best suited to respond to **neurodiversity**, valuing different cognitive strengths.
        - **Critique of Conventional Values:** Critics are mentioned as arguing that the "habits of scholars" promoted in conventional schools often align with **"white, dominant cultural norms"**. This directly links the Conventional orientation to issues of cultural bias and inequity.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The educational orientations framework and the detailed descriptions of each orientation provide a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of education through the lens of the worldview divide. This shows concretely how the dominant worldview (associated with the Conventional orientation) continues to shape educational practices, while the HIL orientation represents a counter-approach rooted in the holistic-indigenous perspective. The discussion of neurodiversity provides scientific evidence supporting the HIL approach's value and highlighting the limitations of the Conventional approach in serving all learners. The critique of cultural norms in conventional schools underscores the social justice issues embedded in current practices.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter is crucial as it demonstrates how the historical worldview divide (Parts 1 & 2, Chapter 2) is not just an academic concept but actively structures and influences present-day educational practices. By defining and contrasting the orientations, particularly the Conventional and HIL ones, it clearly illustrates the problem with the current system and provides a detailed picture of the desired alternative. This chapter bridges the gap between understanding the past and envisioning the future of smart.

**Part 3: Future: Enabling Transformation**

- **Chapter 7: A Path Forward**
    - **Key Themes/Claims:** This chapter focuses on the future, proposing a multi-phase **pathway for transforming the education system** towards the Human-Centered/Liberatory (HIL) orientation. It outlines an "Emergent Theory of Change" and identifies concrete structural changes and policies needed to support HIL programs. It concludes with the compelling **"Our Reason"** for pursuing this transformation.
    - **Important Evidence:**
        - **Phase 1: Creating the Right Conditions:** This initial phase focuses on engaging people in conversations about HIL, building relationships, and providing resources to HIL practitioners. A key task is **codifying and disseminating HIL models**, as designing without a template is difficult. This outlines the initial steps for building the foundation for transformation.
        - **Phase 2: Structural Changes:** This phase involves concrete systemic changes in three areas: 1) **Codification and Dissemination of HIL knowledge** (e.g., creating an instructional-model bank, common outcomes, competencies, assessment resources). 2) **Policymakers crafting HIL-supportive legislation** (e.g., state support systems, authorising "anytime-anywhere" learning credentials, formalising collective accountability). 3) **New educator-preparation programs** designed for HIL environments, credentialing a diverse group of learning guides based on disposition. These detailed proposals provide a vision for the systemic level transformation required.
        - **Collective Accountability:** This is proposed as a replacement for existing state-level accountability systems. It involves balancing internal program interests with those of stakeholders (educators, students, families, HIL networks) to achieve high-quality programs for all students. Oversight would be light and tailored to HIL practice, focusing on understanding performance rather than just ranking based on standardised tests. This offers a specific alternative mechanism for accountability aligned with HIL values.
        - **"Our Reason": Jemar Lee's Story:** The story of Jemar Lee is shared as the motivation ("Our Reason") for this transformative work. Jemar hated school for 16 years, feeling trapped and hopeless, expressing this through misbehaviour. As he got older, his struggles were met with demands to conform ("get used to it," "push through"). This anecdote provides a powerful human example of the negative impact of the conventional system and the urgent need for change that offers hope and purpose to young people.
    - **Relevance of Evidence:** The detailed proposals for Phase 1 and Phase 2 changes provide a tangible plan for achieving the book's vision of a transformed education system. The concept of collective accountability offers a specific alternative to the current accountability paradigm, demonstrating how HIL principles can be applied at a systemic level. Jemar Lee's personal story grounds the abstract arguments for change in a powerful, relatable anecdote, highlighting the human stakes and providing a compelling motivation for the work proposed in the chapter and the book as a whole.
    - **Relevance to Overall Thesis:** This chapter culminates the book's argument by outlining a practical pathway for achieving the transformation it advocates. It translates the historical analysis (Part 1) and the description of alternative practices (Part 2) into concrete steps for systemic change, demonstrating how the vision of a human-centered/liberatory education can be realised. By concluding with "Our Reason," it reinforces the ethical imperative and human motivation behind the book's central thesis â€“ to create an education system where all young people can thrive.
