### Problem

Based on the sources provided and our conversation, the central problem the author, Julie Bogart, is trying to solve in "Raising Critical Thinkers" is the **inadequacy of current approaches (including traditional education and typical critical thinking instruction) in fostering genuine, self-aware critical thinking skills in children and adults**. This inadequacy is seen as particularly problematic in the digital age and the current social environment.

Several facets of this overarching problem are highlighted in the sources:

- **Lack of a clear definition and focus on critical thinking**. Critical thinking often means whatever anyone wants it to mean at institutions like universities.
- **Invisible assumptions and biases control thinking**. Our brains' subconscious learning systems make judgments that sneakily intrude into what we believe are conscious, objective decisions, making it almost supernaturally difficult to surface these biases.
- **Existing approaches often miss the mark**. Most books on critical thinking tend to focus on honing arguments or objectively evaluating data, rather than helping people develop the skills to investigate their _own_ biases or being able to change their mind in the face of compelling reasoning.
- **Traditional education hinders critical thinking**. The belief that schooling automatically creates thinkers is questioned. Children's passion for thinking can end when they are educated for conformity and obedience. Traditional education is often designed to promote mastery of methods and right answers ("banking concept"), not persistent curiosity or problem-solving. This "narration sickness" treats reality as static and compartmentalised, neglecting the child's own experiences and beliefs. Students are often conditioned to wait for teachers to tell them what and how to think, rather than exploring problems themselves. Textbooks can contribute to this by presenting interpretations as facts.
- **The overwhelming digital information landscape**. There is an "endless sea of information on the internet" that learners must navigate. The online environment can also make people "a little lazy" regarding research skills.
- **Difficulty in dispassionately evaluating information and changing one's mind**. People find it difficult to step back and look with dispassion at their decision-making. The book aims to help people develop well-formed opinions _in spite_ of prejudice and bias, and to have the courage to change their minds.

In essence, the book seeks to provide a guide for parents to steer themselves and their children towards a life of considered, thoughtful insight, addressing the need for learners to think more deeply, thoughtfully, and imaginatively about everything in their world, beyond merely passing tests or getting into college.

### What Causes the Problem

Based on the provided sources and our conversation, the problems the author identifies regarding the inadequacy of critical thinking are attributed to several key causes:

- **Invisible Assumptions and Preconceived Biases:** Thinking can be thwarted by invisible assumptions that control our ability to think clearly and rationally. These preconceived biases make it difficult for individuals, even those in positions requiring objectivity like scientists, judges, politicians, and managers, to step back and dispassionately examine their decision-making. These assumptions come from the brain's subconscious procedural learning system, which detects patterns, makes judgments, and whose output "sneakily intrude[s] into what you truly believe". Surfacing these biases is described as "almost supernaturally difficult".
- **Insufficient Focus in Traditional Critical Thinking Approaches:** Many existing books and methods on critical thinking tend to focus on honing one's own argument or objectively evaluating data. They often barely touch on preexisting biases and do not adequately discuss developing skills to investigate one's own biases or the ability to change one's mind in the face of compelling reasoning. They may also concentrate on methods for evaluating objective data without discussing how the mind can fool itself into justifying overriding that data.
- **Failures of Traditional Education:** The sources strongly suggest that traditional schooling actively hinders the development of critical thinkers.
    - There is a belief that schooling automatically creates thinkers, but children's passion for thinking often ends when they are educated for conformity and obedience.
    - Traditional education is often designed to promote mastery of methods and right answers (the "banking concept") rather than persistent curiosity or problem-solving.
    - It is described as suffering from "narration sickness," treating reality as static, compartmentalised, and predictable, neglecting the child's own experiences and beliefs.
    - Students can become conditioned to wait for teachers to tell them what and how to think.
    - Textbooks often present interpretations of facts as facts themselves, reeking of unacknowledged authority.
    - This approach teaches questioning nature "right out of our kids" by age ten, leading them to become cooperative test-takers or, later, potentially "smug, self-righteous know-it-all[s]".
- **The Overwhelming Digital Information Landscape:** Children are described as "swimming in a sea of declarations" and an "endless sea of information on the internet" in the digital environment. The nature of online interaction, where "ranting... has the appearance of confident truth," contributes to this challenging environment. This vast and often unvetted information requires navigating and discerning.
- **Uncritical Acceptance of Narratives and Perspectives:** Without exposure to alternative viewpoints, individuals can align automatically with a single narrative. The "mere exposure effect" means that repetition conditions us to assign positive attributes to information that is frequently encountered, regardless of its truth value. This makes it harder to distrust a familiar version of a story, even if there are clues suggesting it's unreliable.
- **The Subjective and Self-Serving Nature of Human Cognition:** All critical thought is "funneled through a self". Our brains are described as "obsessive meaning-making machines," interpreting information based on limited insight and wrestling it into a worldview that affirms a desired personal "story".
- **Difficulty in Challenging Personal and Community Loyalties:** People find it difficult to give a fair hearing to data or ideas that contradict their own convictions. This can lead to biases like the "ostrich effect," where contradictory evidence is ignored. Furthermore, community, identity, and loyalties significantly influence thinking, providing "logic stories" and interpreting personal perceptions. The fear of disappointing one's community, betraying values, or risking membership can block the ability to think critically about topics that conflict with group beliefs. It is often easier to exclude research or ideas that are disliked and return to an original position rather than learn anything new.

### Solution

Based on the sources and our conversation, the author, Julie Bogart, proposes a multifaceted approach to address the problems of inadequate critical thinking, moving beyond traditional methods and focusing on self-awareness, curiosity, and a deep engagement with information and perspectives. Here are some of the key solutions and tools she presents:

1. **Cultivating Self-Awareness and Addressing Bias:**
    
    - The book aims to help people develop well-formed opinions _in spite_ of prejudice and bias. A core solution is learning to investigate one's _own_ biases.
    - Recognising that critical thought is funneled through a self and that our brains twist information to affirm a desired "story" is a starting point.
    - The author suggests **reading outside your worldview** as a way to train your inevitably biased procedural system to be more open and less one-sided. This is likened to training an artificial intelligence program with broader data.
    - Another approach involves challenging ingrained assumptions by using objective tools to see things differently, similar to how Betty Edwards teaches drawing by having students turn images upside down to confound assumptions and use rulers to see actual proportions.
    - Developing the habit of **exposing first impressions** and checking in with your body's reactions (emotions like fear, worry, anger, delight) as new information is encountered helps track the impact of arguments and identify biases.
    - Peter Elbow's **"believing game"** is offered as an antidote to the "doubting game". Instead of immediately looking for flaws, the believing game involves attempting to understand points of view from the inside, using imaginative, metaphorical, narrative, and personal language, as well as images, sounds, body movements, role-playing, and silence. This helps in understanding ideas that seem wrong at first glance.
2. **Reforming Educational Approaches:**
    
    - The author critiques the "banking concept" of schooling where teachers deposit information and students narrate it back.
    - The proposed solution is **Paulo Freire's "problem-posing education,"** where children are trusted partners in solving meaningful problems with adult collaboration. Educator bell hooks explains this involves teachers taking students on the adventure of critical thinking and breaking with the notion that gaining knowledge is private and competitive.
    - This involves **teachers questioning to provoke thinking** and discover what students know, rather than guiding thinking towards a predetermined answer.
    - John Dewey's "problem-solving" education is also highlighted, focusing on curiosity triggered by an "itch" or disturbance in expectations. The teacher's task is to create this disruption to trigger a need to know.
    - The aim is to grow minds that **think like problem-solvers** rather than only answer-givers.
3. **Navigating the Information Landscape:**
    
    - To deal with the "endless sea of information on the internet", the author recommends developing skills to **vet sources** and differentiate bias from belief or facts from interpretations.
    - Tools include looking for "red flags" such as inflammatory tone/language, challenges to the status quo without sufficient proof, and missing source information. Checking if cited sources lead to the stated origin (e.g., government research linking to a government site) is important.
    - The **"Framing" tool** helps evaluate how the presentation or packaging of a source (human or material, cover design, website type, etc.) might predispose one to think about its content and whether it appears credible. Comparing different sources on the same topic can help assess trustworthiness.
    - For tackling the shallow attention fostered by the digital environment, the author advocates for **deep reading**. This means choosing to engage in a sustained way, giving patient consideration to an idea, and "listening" to the author by building understanding before critiquing. Offline reading is suggested as it gives a better chance to sit with uncomfortable perspectives.
    - Practices that support deep reading include asking questions that draw out a student's personal and visceral reaction to reading ("Up, Down, Both, Why?"), writing reflection essays after reading, and keeping commonplace books to collect thoughts, reactions, and quotes. Freewriting prompts are also provided for reflection.
4. **Understanding and Evaluating Perspectives and Narratives:**
    
    - Recognising the concept of the "unreliable narrator" is a basic step in examining viewpoint. The author suggests retelling stories from different perspectives to understand how background influences narration.
    - Understanding that human beings use "story" (fictions or narratives) to bring together data, opinions, beliefs, and perspectives to explain reality is key. Even experts put research into stories. Identifying the "plot" of an interpretation reveals the storyteller's aims.
    - The **academic disposition** involves witnessing the writer's perspective, making room for dissenting viewpoints, learning first, and critiquing later.
    - An activity involves listing facts from articles without interpretation, noting their sequence, and identifying when interpretations are presented as facts.
    - Cultivating a **"Library of Variety"** is recommended. This involves curating books with a mix of authors and protagonists covering diverse genders, nationalities, races, abilities, socioeconomic statuses, and political affiliations. It also includes a mix of genres and perspectives (historical, personal, statistical, editorial, artistic, factual). Activities involve exploring genres and closely examining details like cover design, font, opening lines, structure, characters, purpose, and author biography to decode information and understand the writer's mission.
    - Learning to identify the genre of a piece of writing is part of the critical thinking task as it helps understand the writer's mission.
5. **Integrating Experience and Encounter:**
    
    - Experience is presented as a way to put ideas to the test.
    - **"Problem-posing" activities** involve intentionally breaking rules in various domains (like math, cooking, sports, language) or imagining alternate histories to provoke insight and understanding.
    - The concept of **"Encounter"** is introduced through "Provocative Questions". This involves asking questions that challenge conventional narratives, such as studying history from marginalized perspectives (like women's letters). Questions focus on identifying who is telling the story, whose voices are ignored or amplified, the goals and beneficiaries, and the underlying values. Retelling the story from a different point of view is also suggested.
    - Iris Marion Young's idea of approaching others with **"wonder"** and curiosity about their point of view, rather than projecting our own, is recommended to facilitate respect when encountering differing ideas.
    - An activity involves reading negative reviews ("green-splat tomatoes") of something one likes to identify different criteria used by reviewers and note personal emotional reactions like defensiveness.
    - To help students engage with topics that conflict with their loyalties, the author provides **specific questions** to ask themselves about what's at stake, what they'd have to give up, who would be disappointed, and the views and practices of their own community. Additionally, questions are provided for understanding the community with the differing viewpoint, focusing on their logic story, values, and how they see one's own community. The solution involves listening directly to members of the "other side".
6. **Developing Deeper Thinking Skills:**
    
    - The book aims to help learners **think more deeply, thoughtfully, and imaginatively** about everything.
    - Part 3 introduces the **rhetorical imagination**, which involves examining academic subjects creatively, analytically, and empathetically, hypothesizing, evaluating, interpreting, problem-solving, and considering competing perspectives dispassionately. This allows students to rise to a "ten-thousand-foot view" of an issue.
    - The goal is to become **fascinated rather than convinced**, conducting research with curiosity about various perspectives instead of defensiveness.
    - The **"Art of Interpretation"** is presented as the apex of critical thinking. The goal is for the reader to realise the truth a text has for them, making it come alive. The **Task of Interpretation Inventory** provides a structured method for this, involving close reading with margin notes, analysing the writing and its original context, reflecting on one's own disposition and reactions, considering the significance and limits of the text, and finally, comparing one's interpretation with others.
    - In discussions of controversial topics, the focus should be on **generating insight** into the complexity of details rather than reducing differences for persuasion. Adam Grant's quote "The hallmark of a productive debate is not persuasion, but insight" is cited to support this.
