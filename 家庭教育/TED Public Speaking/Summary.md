### EP1 What happens when you share an idea?

* Ideas make who we are
* Number one mission as a speaker is to take something/idea that matters deeply to you and rebuild it in the minds of your listeners.
* An idea is something that changes people how they see the world
* Either give your listeners a gift or take them on a journey

### EP2 How to uncover your best ideas?

* Experiences you have that worth sharing
* Everyone has a great talk inside
* You only see yourself inside. But people looking from the outside might see you remarkable
* Have conversation with people who you best. They might see things in you that you miss.
* Ask your questions about your life

### EP3 How to Communicate Clearly

* The purpose of a talk is to say something meaningful because the speaker does not have a proper plan
* The points of the talk need to lead up to a meaningful talk
* The word: *Throughline*. This is the main idea that ties everything the speaker presents
* Everything in the talk should connect to support the main idea
* Pick an idea and make sure everything you speak in the talk links back to the main idea
* *Wrong way*: include everything you need and make them as brief as possible. Skipping out on details and examples. *Over stuffed = Under explained*
* *Right way*: flesh out each point with stories and facts
