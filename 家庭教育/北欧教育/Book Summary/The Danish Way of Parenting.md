Jessica Joelle Alexander and Iben Dissing Sandahl's book, **"The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know About Raising Confident, Capable Kids"**, explores the unique Danish parenting philosophy that the authors believe is a primary reason for Denmark's consistent ranking as one of the happiest nations in the world.

Authored by an American mother (Jessica Joelle Alexander) married to a Dane and a Danish psychotherapist (Iben Dissing Sandahl), the book delves into the cultural differences in raising children, contrasting Danish practices with typical American approaches. Jessica's personal journey, starting from her initial "lack of natural mothering skills" and her exposure to Danish culture through her husband, led her to seek a different parenting philosophy, which profoundly changed her life. The authors aim to share this "Danish Way" as a step-by-step guide to help parents raise "resilient, emotionally secure, happy kids who turn into resilient, emotionally secure, happy adults".

The core principles of "The Danish Way of Parenting" are summarised by the acronym **PARENT**:

- **P is for Play**:
    
    - The book highlights the significant decrease in children's free play in the United States over the past fifty years, influenced by technology, parental fears, and a desire to "develop" children through structured activities.
    - In contrast, Danish culture deeply values unstructured, child-led "free play". It is seen not as a waste of time but as crucial for a child's development, teaching resilience, emotion regulation, coping skills, and self-control.
    - Danish children historically, and often currently, start formal schooling later (around age seven) to prioritise play. Even after school, "free-time school" encourages play.
    - Play helps children develop an **internal locus of control**, meaning they believe they can control their own lives and respond to challenges, which is crucial for preventing anxiety and depression.
    - The chapter provides practical tips for fostering play, such as turning off electronics, creating enriching environments, encouraging outdoor exploration, mixing age groups, and letting children play freely without adult intervention.
- **A is for Authenticity**:
    
    - Authenticity involves recognising and accepting all emotions, both good and bad, and acting in ways consistent with one's values.
    - The book contrasts Danish films and Hans Christian Andersen's original fairy tales, which often have realistic or tragic endings, with the American preference for "syrupy-sweet" happy endings. This exposure to reality helps people reflect on their own lives with gratitude and perspective.
    - Danish parenting emphasises **emotional honesty** and modelling it for children, acknowledging all feelings to help children learn to regulate them in the future.
    - The book critiques "self-deception"—ignoring real feelings for external influences—as a path to unhappiness.
    - A key aspect is the "Danish Way of Authentic Praise" which promotes **humility** and focuses on **"process praise"** (praising effort and perseverance) rather than "fixed mind-set" praise (praising innate intelligence or talent). Research by Carol S. Dweck supports that process praise fosters a **growth mind-set**, leading to greater resilience and a lifelong desire to learn.
- **R is for Reframing**:
    
    - Reframing is the skill of reinterpreting an event or situation to view it in a more positive or constructive light.
    - Danes are described as "realistic optimists" who acknowledge reality but focus on less negative aspects, avoiding black-and-white thinking. This contrasts with "limiting language" that defines people or situations negatively.
    - Reframing is a key component of **resilience** and has been shown to decrease negative brain activity and emotional responses.
    - With children, reframing means helping them shift focus from what they _can't_ do to what they _can_, and seeing situations from different angles. This includes using "externalization language" to separate the behavior from the child (e.g., "She is _affected by_ laziness" instead of "She _is_ lazy") and rewriting negative narratives about themselves.
    - Humor is also a tool for reframing, acknowledging a negative situation but guiding towards a more positive perspective.
- **E is for Empathy**:
    
    - Empathy is defined as the ability to recognise and understand others' feelings, to "feel with them".
    - The book notes an alarming drop in empathy and a rise in narcissism among young people in the US since the 1980s.
    - While American culture often emphasises individualism and competition ("survival of the fittest"), neuroscience research on the "social brain" suggests humans are wired for connection and the welfare of others. The "prisoner's dilemma" study, for example, showed more pleasure from cooperation than from individual winning.
    - Parents have a responsibility to model empathy, as children mirror their behavior. Overprotective parenting can hinder a child's empathy development.
    - Danish schools implement mandatory programmes like "Step by Step" and "CAT-kit" to teach children to identify and verbalise emotions, problem-solve, and develop self-control without judgment. They also subtly mix children of different strengths to foster collaboration and respect.
    - Danes actively use language that highlights good character qualities in others in front of their children, promoting trust and understanding. Reading diverse stories (including sad ones) is also encouraged to increase empathy levels.
- **N is for No Ultimatums**:
    
    - The book discusses the prevalence of physical punishment (spanking) in the US, noting that studies show it is ineffective long-term and linked to negative developmental outcomes like depression, anxiety, and aggression. Spanking has been illegal in Denmark since 1997.
    - Danish parenting aligns with the "authoritative" style—demanding but responsive, setting clear rules while supporting children's questions about them. They view children as "intrinsically good" and "pushing boundaries" (their term for "terrible twos") as normal, rather than misbehaviour deserving of punishment.
    - A household full of yelling is rare in Denmark, with parents striving to remain calm to model self-control for their children.
    - The emphasis is on **parenting with respect**, explaining rules, and fostering trust rather than fear. Children are encouraged to understand _why_ rules exist.
    - Danish schools involve students in creating class rules and use strategies like "differentiatere" (seeing each student as an individual) and tools to help children manage energy or focus, aiming to avoid problems rather than just punishing them.
    - The approach advocates for separating the "bad behavior" from the "child" to avoid negative labelling and encourage positive change.
- **T is for Togetherness and Hygge**:
    
    - **Hygge** (pronounced "hooga") is a uniquely Danish concept meaning "to cozy around together". It is a way of life that involves creating a warm, cozy atmosphere with loved ones through activities like lighting candles, eating, playing games, and intentionally being present and positive together.
    - Research shows that quality time with friends and family is a top predictor of well-being and happiness. Strong social ties are linked to better physical health and resilience to stress.
    - This contrasts with the strong individualism prevalent in American culture, where self-reliance and individual achievement are often prioritised over collective well-being.
    - Danish culture fosters **teamwork** from an early age, in schools and family life, by encouraging cooperation and mutual support.
    - The book introduces a "Hygge Oath" for families to commit to a shared goal of positive togetherness, leaving drama and negativity at the door.
    - Practical tips include having fun together, keeping things simple, limiting screen time, singing, and building community support networks, especially for new mothers.

The authors conclude that by understanding and incorporating these Danish parenting principles—examining one's "default settings" and consciously choosing to apply these methods—parents can significantly enhance the happiness, resilience, and confidence of their children and future generations.
