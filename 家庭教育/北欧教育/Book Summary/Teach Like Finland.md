Timothy D. Walker's book, **"Teach Like Finland: 33 Simple Strategies for Joyful Classrooms"**, explores the educational philosophy and practical strategies employed in Finnish schools, which the author believes contribute to their high performance and joyful learning environments [1, xxv, xxviii, 31]. The book aims to provide American teachers, and educators worldwide, with actionable ideas to incorporate more happiness and enjoyment into their classrooms, even despite systemic differences.

The author, Timothy D. Walker, moved with his family from Boston to Helsinki in 2013 and taught an English-speaking fifth-grade class at a Helsinki public school for two years. His personal journey into Finnish education began after experiencing significant stress and burnout during his first year of teaching in Massachusetts, working long hours (typically twelve-hour days) and feeling a constant pressure to push himself "to the limit". He contrasted this with his Finnish wife's friend, a first-grade teacher in Helsinki, who worked no more than six hours daily, including prep, and left her work behind at 2:00 P.M.. Walker initially doubted this Finnish approach, but his own struggles led him to explore "another way to teach" and thrive.

Finland gained international attention for its educational success after the 2001 PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) results, where it scored highest among 31 OECD countries in reading, mathematics, and science, with little variation in student achievement and less influence from family background. This unexpected success, achieved with "modest spending" and a "softer approach of short schools days, light homework loads, and little standardized testing," challenged conventional wisdom in education globally. The book argues that many of Finland's pedagogical innovations were adopted from North America, but Finns prioritize happiness more than achievement, making small, simple decisions that promote joyful teaching and learning, which ultimately leads to strong student performance.

Walker organises his 33 strategies around **five key ingredients of happiness: well-being, belonging, autonomy, mastery, and mind-set**, drawing on the work of Raj Raghunathan and adding "well-being" as a foundational component [34, xxix].

**1. Well-being** This section focuses on promoting the physical, emotional, and mental health of both teachers and students.

- **Schedule Brain Breaks:** Finnish schools typically incorporate a fifteen-minute break for every forty-five minutes of instruction, often spent outdoors, regardless of weather. Walker initially resisted this, trying to replicate longer American instructional blocks, but observed that frequent breaks kept students more focused and energetic. Research supports that regular breaks boost attentiveness, productivity, and creativity by allowing the brain to rest and consolidate information. While full Finnish-style breaks may be difficult to implement everywhere, teachers can offer shorter "choice time" (e.g., free reading, writing, or fun math games) that are enjoyable, independent, and novel.
- **Learn on the Move:** Despite short school days and frequent breaks, Finnish children's physical activity levels are low, similar to American children. However, Finland has a government initiative called "Finnish Schools on the Move," which encourages activity throughout the day. Strategies include "recess activators" (older students leading games for younger ones), offering longer breaks for self-directed activities, and integrating movement into lessons (e.g., "energizers," standing work, active gallery walks). Physical activity improves cognitive functions, memory, attention, and mental health.
- **Recharge After School:** Finnish teachers typically work fewer hours in the classroom (around 18 hours per week for elementary teachers) than their OECD counterparts (e.g., U.S. teachers average 26.8 hours). They prioritize going home by 4:00 P.M. and leaving work at school to recharge, viewing it as crucial for preventing burnout and maintaining effectiveness. Walker emphasizes that recharging is not self-serving but essential for stability and presence for students. This also extends to homework, where Finnish teachers assign reasonable amounts that can be completed easily by students on their own, recognizing the value of children's free time.
- **Simplify the Space:** Finnish classrooms often feature a minimalist, uncluttered design, mirroring Finnish home aesthetics. Research by Carnegie Mellon University suggests that highly decorated classrooms can distract young children, leading to more off-task behavior and smaller learning gains. Displaying student work is valued, but Finnish teachers exercise restraint, focusing on purpose rather than simply filling walls. Simplicity can save teacher time, facilitate higher-quality student work, and promote less distracted learning.
- **Breathe Fresh Air:** Finnish schools often open windows in classrooms to ensure good air quality. Minna Räihä, a Finnish teacher, explained that high carbon dioxide levels "stop learning". A study on office workers supported this, showing significantly higher cognitive function scores in environments with better air quality. Finnish schools also mandate outdoor time for elementary students, even in cold or rainy weather, believing fresh air is beneficial. The book suggests minimizing artificial lighting and maintaining an optimal temperature range for learning as other environmental factors to consider.
- **Get into the Wild:** Finland encourages environment-based education, with children spending time outdoors, often unsupervised by adults, in nature. Richard Louv, who coined "nature-deficit disorder," praises Finland for this. Research suggests that time in nature builds confidence, reduces ADHD symptoms, calms children, aids focus, and can reduce bullying and obesity. Strategies include bringing nature into the classroom (e.g., sprouting plants), stepping outside for lessons (e.g., using the schoolyard as a habitat), and greening school grounds (e.g., butterfly gardens).
- **Keep the Peace:** Finnish schools prioritize creating a peaceful and calm learning environment. This is reflected in the Finnish language, with terms like "saunarauha" (sauna peace). While American classrooms promote active learning and teacher talk, Finnish classrooms often allow "long stretches of time" for quiet independent work. Research indicates that background noise can impair children's word acquisition and learning. Strategies include co-creating classroom rules (e.g., "respect yourself, respect others, and respect the environment") and anchor charts, using student-made "noise meters," and striking a balance between quiet work and discussion. The chapter also introduces **mindfulness** exercises (e.g., mindful listening, mindful walking) as simple, short activities to promote self-awareness, self-regulation, and reduce stress, thereby enhancing attentiveness and emotional control in students.

**2. Belonging** This section highlights the importance of cultivating a sense of connectedness for both teachers and students.

- **Recruit a Welfare Team:** Teachers need to experience belonging with other adults. In Finland, classroom teachers meet with a "Student Welfare Team" (principal, nurse, social worker, psychologist, special education teacher) to discuss individual student needs. This practice fosters a shared responsibility for students, making teachers feel "less alone". The author suggests American teachers can adopt a similar practice by calling on a small, trusted group of professionals for regular check-ins.
- **Know Each Child:** Finnish teachers often stay with the same group of students for multiple years, building strong rapport. To speed up relationship building, Walker suggests greeting students by name at the door (with fist bumps or high fives) and engaging in brief, personal conversations. Eating lunch with students is another effective strategy for casual, non-academic connection. Home visits before the school year can also profoundly impact relationships, signalling care and providing insights into students' lives.
- **Play with Your Students:** Finnish schools often start the year with a "soft start," prioritizing games, exercise, and team building (ryhmäyttäminen) over immediate textbook work or strict routines. The author recounts playing "Kick the Can" daily with his fifth graders, highlighting how playing together calms jitters and builds camaraderie. Structured games like "human bingo" are also suggested for getting to know students.
- **Celebrate Their Learning:** Finnish classrooms, like home economics classes, reserve time for students to enjoy and appreciate their completed work. This celebration is seen as intrinsically motivating, promoting achievement, autonomy, and a sense of belonging. Examples include "book talks" where students present their chosen books to classmates, and class exhibitions like "Coffeehouse Poetry Day".
- **Pursue a Class Dream:** Experiences like "Camp School," where Finnish fifth or sixth graders spend several days in nature with teachers, foster strong classroom unity and responsibility, as students often fundraise for the trip themselves. This bonding experience promotes connectedness. Class dreams don't have to be as ambitious as Camp School; they can be student-chosen projects like producing a music album, hiking a mountain, or creating an app. The key is shared decision-making and involvement of everyone, including other teachers and parents.
- **Banish the Bullying:** Finland has a nationwide anti-bullying program called **KiVa** (kiusaamista vastaan, meaning "against bullying"), implemented in 90% of schools, which significantly improves mental health of bullied children. KiVa includes preventive instruction, role-playing, and a clear protocol for addressing bullying-like behavior, focusing on solutions rather than just apologies, and involving trained older students in conflict resolution sessions.
- **Buddy Up:** Finnish schools often have a tradition of older students (e.g., sixth graders) teaming up with younger ones (e.g., first graders). This "buddy system" boosts the younger students' sense of belonging and gives older students a greater sense of purpose and responsibility. This low-prep strategy fosters collaboration and a heightened sense of belonging within the school community.

**3. Autonomy** This section discusses giving students freedom and responsibility to enhance their self-direction and happiness.

- **Start with Freedom:** Walker challenged the "gradual release of responsibility" model, advocating for starting with "significant freedom" in the classroom. He observed that his Finnish students, already very independent (e.g., commuting to school alone even as first graders), thrived when given autonomy. Examples include students independently organizing a bake sale for fundraising and an "Independent Learning Week" where students completed tasks at their own pace without constant teacher supervision. This approach helps teachers see what students are capable of doing, similar to a pretest.
- **Leave Margin:** Designing lessons with "margin" or "flexible time" allows for important tweaks and interventions. While Finnish schools have scheduled fifteen-minute breaks for this, teachers can also build margin into lessons, especially in workshop models where students work independently, allowing teachers to provide immediate, meaningful feedback. A "Do Now" activity at the start of a lesson (a short, independent task) can also create this margin, allowing teachers to check in with students individually.
- **Offer Choices:** Students thrive when given choices. The author learned from his "Independent Learning Week" experience that offering diverse options connected to student interests, rather than assigning uniform tasks, significantly enhances autonomy and engagement. Finnish kindergarten educators emphasize connecting student passions (e.g., Angry Birds) to the curriculum through open-ended activities that allow for categorization, counting, story-building, and role-playing.
- **Plan with Your Students:** Co-planning—sharing responsibility for determining the direction of learning—is essential for developing student agency and joy. Finland's new curriculum requires interdisciplinary units planned with student input. Walker's experience with a sustainable development project on solar energy, co-designed with his students, showed increased motivation, interest, and commitment to high-quality work when students had ownership in the planning. Using KWL charts can be part of this process, particularly focusing on what students "want to know" to genuinely shape the unit.
- **Make it Real:** Connecting schoolwork to "real-world" applications fosters purpose and joy. Finland's "Me & MyCity" (Yrityskylä) program allows sixth graders to run a miniature city for a day, taking on professional roles and managing businesses. This innovative program, inspired by American "BizTown," has shown to increase economic knowledge and interest in saving money. Other examples include students using real needles in textiles class or a blowtorch in woodworking, and kindergartners running a realistic ice cream shop, all creating more relevant learning contexts.
- **Demand Responsibility:** Finnish schools operate on a high level of **professional trust** for teachers, which translates into a culture of trusting children with significant responsibilities from an early age (e.g., commuting independently, serving themselves food in cafeterias). This contrasts with the American emphasis on "accountability". The author argues that fear-driven accountability stifles joy and meaningful responsibility. Allowing students to take more responsibility, for example, in assessment (e.g., self-evaluating or grading their own papers), can reduce teacher workload and stress, while fostering student ownership and immediate feedback. Limiting "crutches" like excessive graphic organizers or binders encourages students to develop their own organizational skills.

**4. Mastery** This section focuses on developing competence and expertise in students.

- **Teach the Essentials:** Walker found that Finland's lighter teaching schedule (fewer instructional hours than the U.S.) compelled him to plan more efficiently and "prioritize the essentials" of the curriculum, rather than getting distracted by auxiliary activities. Finnish teachers often use traditional, teacher-directed instruction, including textbooks, lecturing, and copying from the blackboard, to pace units and lessons and ensure content mastery. The goal is to focus on curricular objectives and content, not just "flashy" activities.
- **Mine the Textbook:** Unlike American educators who sometimes mistrust commercial curricula, Finnish teachers view textbooks as useful resources that help them stay focused on essential content, keep pace, and lighten their planning load. Walker suggests "mining the textbook" – using the good parts, aligning with curriculum goals, and creating more engaging activities when needed, rather than abandoning them.
- **Leverage the Tech:** While some American schools invest heavily in the latest technology, Finnish schools often have more modest tech setups. An OECD PISA assessment on digital skills found that while moderate computer use improves learning outcomes, "students who use computers very frequently at school do much worse". Finnish teachers use technology "modestly" to support learning (e.g., document cameras, Google Classroom for collaboration), rather than it becoming a distraction. The focus is on technology as a tool that enhances teaching, not an end in itself.
- **Bring in the Music:** Finnish schools prioritize music instruction, with some having as many music lessons as math. Research links music training to academic success, particularly for low-income children, by improving literacy, linguistic skills, memory, and focus. Teachers can integrate music into academic lessons (e.g., hip-hop for story elements, songs for continents) to engage students, strengthen neural connections, and enhance language and math skills.
- **Coach More:** Finnish teachers often adopt a "learning by doing" philosophy, acting as coaches who circulate, meet with students, and offer specific, honest, and constructive feedback. This contrasts with teachers who "talk until the cows come home". The "workshop model" (mini-lesson, active independent work, group reflection) is highlighted as a framework that facilitates learning by doing and provides opportunities for effective coaching. Incorporating clear, achievable "learning targets" (student-understood objectives) and providing exemplars of successful work helps students aim for and achieve mastery.
- **Prove the Learning:** While Finland has a "relative" lack of standardized tests, Finnish teachers use summative assessments, often giving number grades in elementary school. However, there's a push for more formative assessment and narrative feedback. Finnish teachers customize tests and often ask students to "perustella" (justify) their answers, requiring critical and creative thinking. This practice is believed to contribute to Finland's high PISA scores.
- **Discuss the Grades:** Some Finnish high school teachers (like Pekka Peura) have moved away from traditional tests, instead allowing students to self-assess and agree on a final grade with the teacher in brief conferences. This respectful communication about grades fosters reflection and ownership of learning, helping students understand their progress towards mastery.

**5. Mind-set** This section explores the underlying attitudes that contribute to joyful teaching and learning, particularly the "abundance-oriented approach".

- **Seek Flow:** The book encourages teachers to seek "flow," a mental state described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi as being completely involved in an activity, where "the ego falls away" and "time flies". Flow enhances performance and skills. It's fostered by intrinsically satisfying, challenging yet feasible tasks, and total focus. In Finnish schools, the author observed a non-competitive mind-set that aids collaboration and helps teachers achieve flow regularly, as they are not distracted by striving for "superiority" over colleagues.
- **Have a Thicker Skin:** Finnish teachers demonstrate "sisu" (guts or bravery in adversity), a resilience that protects their joy of teaching when facing challenging interactions with parents, students, or colleagues. This means being confident in one's expertise as a professional and not being easily discouraged or intimidated. Journaling about anxieties and reflecting on "realities" can help put frustrations into perspective, and practicing gratitude ("metastrategy") can boost happiness and diminish the desire for superiority.
- **Collaborate Over Coffee:** Collaboration is a key source of joy for Finnish teachers, who view it as a necessity rather than a luxury. They regularly collaborate during breaks, planning, problem-solving, discussing student needs, and even grading together. This face-to-face interaction fosters a "better teacher" mindset and a supportive community. Regularly visiting the teachers' lounge for casual interactions helps facilitate greater collaboration.
- **Welcome the Experts:** Finnish colleagues frequently invite each other's classes into their classrooms for introductory lessons or to share expertise. This practice allows teachers to view themselves as "resource managers," taking pressure off by not needing to be a "jack-of-all-trades". Welcoming experts (including colleagues, parents, and even students) affirms their knowledge, enhances learning, and combats a "scarcity-minded worldview".
- **Vacate on Vacation:** Finnish teachers disconnect for significant periods during summer holidays, often going to summer cottages and avoiding school-related work. This extended time for rest and relaxation helps them recharge and prepare for the next school year, leading to higher job satisfaction and productivity. The author suggests a hybrid approach for American teachers: dedicating a "healthy chunk of time for disconnecting" and another for professional development, emphasizing the importance of a true "summer holiday mind-set" to fully benefit from time off.
- **Don't Forget Joy:** The book's culminating strategy is to prioritize joy in classrooms. Research from Bhutan showed that a "happiness curriculum" significantly boosted student well-being and academic achievement, suggesting these are not antagonistic but mutually reinforcing. The new Finnish core curriculum (2016) also prioritizes joy as a learning concept. Regularly reminding oneself to maximize happiness through small, conscious decisions can contribute to greater overall happiness for both teachers and students.
