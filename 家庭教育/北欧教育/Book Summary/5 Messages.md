Here are five surprising and important messages that a Chinese parent can learn from the sources provided:

- **Prioritise Joy and Well-being as the Foundation for Success, Not a Reward for It.** The sources suggest that happiness and well-being are fundamental goals in Finnish education and Danish parenting, serving as precursors to success, rather than merely outcomes of achievement. In Finland, for example, a "softer approach" that includes short school days, light homework loads, and minimal standardised testing has still led to admirable learning outcomes. The authors of _The Danish Way of Parenting_ explicitly state that "happiness is not the outcome of success but rather its precursor". This perspective contrasts with a common cultural emphasis on intense academic pressure and external achievement, which can lead to stress and burnout in children and parents alike.
    
- **Embrace Unstructured Play and Frequent Breaks as Essential Learning Tools.** Instead of long, uninterrupted instructional periods, Finnish schools incorporate frequent fifteen-minute "brain breaks" throughout the day, which have been shown to keep students refreshed and more focused during lessons. Danish and Scandinavian parenting philosophies deeply value **free, unstructured play—even outdoors in all kinds of weather**—as a crucial form of "serious learning". They believe that such play helps children develop vital life skills like resilience, self-control, negotiation, and coping mechanisms for stress. This challenges the notion that more structured activities or earlier academic instruction necessarily lead to better outcomes, suggesting that less direct instruction can actually be more effective for development and learning.
    
- **Foster Autonomy and "Freedom with Responsibility," Including Permitting Risky Play.** Finnish children are observed to be much more autonomous, and teachers are encouraged to "start with freedom" in the classroom to develop student agency. Similarly, Scandinavian parents practice "freedom with responsibility," gradually giving children more unsupervised time to play and explore, and allowing them to engage in "risky play" such as climbing trees or using real tools. This approach aims to cultivate independence, self-reliance, and the ability to assess and manage risks from within, rather than relying on constant adult supervision or external control. This may be surprising for parents who tend to maintain tighter control over their children's activities for safety or academic reasons.
    
- **Cultivate Authenticity and Emotional Honesty, Focusing Praise on Effort (Process Praise).** The Danish way of parenting encourages children to **recognise and accept all their authentic emotions—both positive and negative**—and to act in alignment with their values, even when discussing difficult topics. Instead of over-praising children for being "smart" or "talented," Danish parents tend to focus on praising their _effort_ and the _process_ involved in learning. Research indicates that this "process praise" helps children develop a "growth mind-set," where they understand that intelligence and skills can be developed through hard work, fostering greater persistence and resilience in the face of challenges. This contrasts with practices that might shy away from uncomfortable emotions or focus heavily on innate ability.
    
- **Adopt a Democratic Parenting Style that Builds Trust and Avoids Ultimatums.** Danish parenting is described as democratic, eschewing physical punishment (spanking became illegal in Denmark in 1997) and excessive yelling. This approach fosters trust and a stronger sense of self-control in children. Danes tend to view children as intrinsically good, seeing boundary-pushing as a normal part of development (referred to as the "boundary age" rather than "terrible twos"). Parents focus on explaining rules and the reasons behind them, working _with_ their children to understand expectations, rather than imposing ultimatums. This stands in stark contrast to more authoritarian parenting models that might rely on fear and strict discipline to achieve obedience.
