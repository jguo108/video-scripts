• Late Chapters: Synthesis ('2020 meta-analysis confirming...')  
Highlight what changed in the author’s perspective over time."*

---

### "If-Then" Rule Extraction

#### Prompt
*"Identify practical decision-making rules from the book using this format:  
'IF [situation], THEN [action based on book’s lesson], BECAUSE [rationale from text].'

### Epistemic Confidence Check

### **Pro Tips for Better Results**  
1. **Iterative Prompting**: Start with broad prompts, then drill down (e.g., *"Focus on Chapter 7’s argument about inflation"*).  
2. **Cross-Verification**: Use Perplexity.ai to fact-check claims against latest data.  
3. **Contextualization**: Add *"Compare this to [author’s previous work]"* for depth.  
4. **Bias Check**: Ask *"What perspectives/evidence are missing from this analysis?"*  

**Best Tools for Non-Fiction:**  
• **Claude 3** (200k token context for whole-book analysis)  
• **ChatGPT + Code Interpreter** (upload book PDFs for direct quotes)  
• **Mem.ai** (organize concepts into knowledge graphs)  

These prompts force AI to move beyond superficial summaries, revealing how ideas interconnect and where the book succeeds (or fails) to persuade. Always verify critical claims with original text excerpts!
