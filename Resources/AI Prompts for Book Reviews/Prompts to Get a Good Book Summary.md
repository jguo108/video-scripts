### Argument Structure

Given the following different types of typical argument structures use in non-fiction books, can you tell me what structure this book uses? It can be a single structure or a combine of them:

1. **Problem-Solution**:  
   • **Structure**: Identify a problem, analyze its causes, and propose solutions.  
   • **Example**: Climate change books outlining environmental crises (problem) and advocating renewable energy (solution).

2. **Chronological**:  
   • **Structure**: Present ideas or events in sequential order, often to show historical progression or development.  
   • **Example**: Biographies or histories like *Sapiens*, tracing human evolution over time.

3. **Compare and Contrast**:  
   • **Structure**: Examine similarities and differences between ideas, theories, or subjects.  
   • **Example**: Analyzing capitalism vs. socialism in political economy texts.

4. **Cause and Effect**:  
   • **Structure**: Explore relationships between actions/events (causes) and outcomes (effects).  
   • **Example**: Linking industrialization (cause) to urban sprawl and pollution (effects).

5. **Thematic**:  
   • **Structure**: Organize content by themes or topics, each supporting the central argument.  
   • **Example**: A sociology book dividing chapters into race, class, and gender themes.

6. **Thesis-Support**:  
   • **Structure**: State a central claim upfront, then provide evidence, data, and analysis to validate it.  
   • **Example**: *The God Delusion* positing atheism as rational, backed by scientific and philosophical arguments.

7. **Narrative/Story-Driven**:  
   • **Structure**: Use anecdotes, case studies, or personal stories to illustrate points.  
   • **Example**: *Educated* weaving memoir elements to discuss resilience and education.

8. **List-Based**:  
   • **Structure**: Present ideas as a numbered list of principles, steps, or rules.  
   • **Example**: Self-help books like *Atomic Habits*, outlining actionable strategies.

9. **Analytical**:  
   • **Structure**: Break down complex subjects into components for detailed examination.  
   • **Example**: *Freakonomics* dissecting economic forces behind social behaviors.

10. **Pro-Con**:  
    ◦ **Structure**: Weigh arguments for and against a position before advocating a stance.  
    ◦ **Example**: Tech ethics books debating AI’s benefits vs. risks.
