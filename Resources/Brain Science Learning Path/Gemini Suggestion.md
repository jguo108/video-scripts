### **Stage 2: Core Mechanisms (Cognitive Psychology & Memory)**

This stage moves into the specific processes—thinking, attention, memory, and decision-making—that shape learning.

|**Focus Area**|**Popular Science Book Recommendations**|
|---|---|
|**Decision Making & Two Systems of Thinking**|**1. _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman.** (The seminal work on System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking.)|
|**Memory & Retrieval Practice**|**2. _Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_ by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel.** (A highly practical book based on cognitive science principles like retrieval practice and spacing.)|
|**Human Perception & Cognitive Quirks**|**3. _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales_ by Oliver Sacks.** (A classic collection of neurological case studies that illustrate how the brain and mind work by showing what happens when they go wrong.)|
|**Focus and Distraction**|**4. _Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention—and How to Think Deeply Again_ by Johann Hari.** (A look at the societal and technological factors impacting our attention and concentration.)|

### **Stage 3: Application & Development (Executive Functions & Real-World Learning)**

This stage focuses on the higher-level control systems and how learning is applied, particularly in development.

|**Focus Area**|**Popular Science Book Recommendations**|
|---|---|
|**Executive Functions (General)**|**1. _Executive Functions: What They Are, How They Work, and Why They Evolved_ by Russell A. Barkley.** (A deep dive into the specific components of self-control, planning, and working memory.)|

### **Stage 4: Integration & Synthesis (Teaching & Meta-Learning)**

The final stage is about mastering the art of teaching, self-regulation, and integrating all previous knowledge into a cohesive strategy.

| **Focus Area**                            | **Popular Science Book Recommendations**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
