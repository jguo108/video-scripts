1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,433
a lot of these AI tools are getting better

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:04,666
but that only means they can do

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,200
certain set of instructions

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,633
which are seen in data

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,400
you still need to provide AI what to do right

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,533
you still need to be able to describe it

7
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:14,333
and that

8
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,000
ability to describe what are the tasks AI should do

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,200
what are the programs to be written is still important

10
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,733
I think one job that will not be replaced by AI

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,100
is the ability to be curious

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,933
and go after hard problems

13
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,133
so for young people

14
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,033
my advice is not to be afraid of AI or worry

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,866
what skills to learn that AI may replace them with

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,666
but really be in that path of curiosity

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,833
I always begin the classes by asking questions

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,000
not writing down math equations right

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,700
not going into the details

20
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,100
but just intuitively

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,133
based on everything that you've seen

22
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,033
you've done what do you think

23
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,233
many times people already may be somewhat aware of this

24
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,833
so they have some intuitive ideas

25
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,266
so that already is a good starting point

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,333
and sometimes they are maybe really wrong

27
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,866
they have an intuition but that's a wrong intuition

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,000
but it's still okay

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,666
because intuitions are not always the only answer right

30
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,400
so I think a lot of it comes by asking questions

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,733
and now you can

32
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,800
use these AI tools to get answers very quickly

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,133
and also verify them

34
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,866
a lot of it comes from

35
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,300
being just like curious or interested

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,233
that could be one specific topic

37
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,733
and if somebody is interested in music they can

38
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:28,900
delve deeper into that

39
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,433
if somebody is interested in art

40
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,866
so it just has to that spark has to come from within

41
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:37,833
and I think giving students more the freedom to pursue

42
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:41,033
where they are passionate where they have a spark

43
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,066
I think is going to be the future

44
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,133
and that's the right thing

45
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,900
rather than forcing everybody to learn everything

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,666
so my mission is to constantly be curious

47
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,266
and learning and

48
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,033
not assume that

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,600
any problem is easy

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,233
I can't imagine a world

51
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,200
where scientists will be out of jobs

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
because the definition of a scientist

53
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:05,933
is somebody who tackles open problems right

54
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,500
so there are harder and harder problems to tackle

55
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,933
you know if you want to look

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,233
at the deep secrets of our universe

57
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,333
go down to the smallest scale

58
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:19,400
and understand at the atomic and sub atomic level how

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,200
matter is constructed to of course

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,900
level of galaxy and beyond

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,933
and understand how the universe is

62
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,566
put together there are still lots of open challenges

63
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,800
to me human agency is driving

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,133
AI to do something that you want it to be done

65
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,000
you have the agency as a human

66
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,466
to decide what tasks AI does

67
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:45,266
and then you're evaluating and you're in charge right

68
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,000
so you go and verify whether what AI

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
is saying is true or not

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
and then over time

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,333
provide that feedback to AI and make it get better

72
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,500
AI is a tool

73
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,433
it can both help curiosity

74
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:01,633
but also kill it depending on how it's used right

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
so for young people

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,866
my advice is not to be afraid of AI or worry

77
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,700
what skills to learn that AI may replace them with

78
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,466
but really be in that path of curiosity right

79
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:17,000
use AI as a tool to drive that curiosity

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,866
learn new skills new knowledge

81
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,733
and you can do that in a much more interactive way
