problem solving to the next level

think outside the box

think inside the barrier

This 10-episode narrative follows a girl, Ethic, and her robot companion, Hedge, as they attempt to save the world. The two embark on a quest to collect three artifacts and must solve their way through a series of programming puzzles.

#### Concepts
* Conditional (2:09) 

### EP3 The Furnace Bots ([The Furnace Bots | Think Like A Coder, Ep 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQPArC8NN5o&list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or&index=4))

Find the original furnace bot and make it send instructions to all child bots
#### Concepts

* Break down the problem into smaller pieces: *Decomposition* (5:58)

### EP5 The Artists ([The Artists | Think Like A Coder, Ep 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mOev8v3D1U&list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or&index=6))

Director of the colony, Octavia. Create distraction by painting each portrait with an X.
Start with one special case and work towards the general.
#### Concepts
* Painting is made of Pixels
* Find patterns of a solution to a class of similar problems: *Pattern Recognition* (2:50)

### EP6 The Chasm ([The Chasm | Think Like A Coder, Ep 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbM-zSkjvHo&list=PLJicmE8fK0EgogMqDYMgcADT1j5b911or&index=7))

Build a bridge to access the artifact. The bridge needs to be a palindrome.

Check if a pile of blocks can form a palindrome. Start with naive solution and work towards better solutions. 

Insight: at most ONE letter can appear an odd number of times, and the rest have to be even.
#### Concepts
* Brute force vs. Clever Algorithm (2:40)
* Data structure: Dictionary (4:44)

Lemma, a scientist work to bring down the machines. Finding path the to final artifact through a binary tree.
#### Concepts
* Recursion (3:00)
* Path finder
* Functions, procedures and sub-routines
